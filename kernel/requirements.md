# To build the Neko Kernel you'll need the following programs/packages:
1. gcc (for c compilation, clang support is planned)
2. nasm (for asm compilation)
3. make (to build the kernel... duh!)
4. grub-mkrescue (to create an .iso file with grub)
5. xorriso (needed by grub-mkrescue for .iso support)

# Optional:
1. tput (for color during compilation. Usually installed by the default in most distros)
2. qemu (for testing the kernel)
3. virtualbox (for testing the kernel)
