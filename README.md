# NekoOS
A little microkernel + planned userland

> What is NekoOS?

Nothing special. Just a little project I like spending my free time on. Will probably not be as professional as Linux or any BSD.

> What is implemented?

Nothing desu. At it's current form it only boots and displays a message. Hopefully I'll be able to recreate my old kernel in a more organised way (^.^).

## File structure

- system/
	- boards/
		- rpi3/ (and other boards, not implemented yet tho)
	- The main.c and other files.
- userland/
	- The userland.
	
## Compiling
Currently compiling is done by simply running `make`

## Plans for next push :3
* ???

## Goals
* Epic lulz and fun while making it.
* Create an operating system that is cute but *probably* useless in any practical scenario.
* Mini FAT32
